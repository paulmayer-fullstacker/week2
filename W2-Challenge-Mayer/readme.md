# Submission: Build a Multi-page Responsive Website

## Introduction:

Herewith my submission for Week-2's challenge: a multi-page responsive website. The solution features semantic HTML and CSS styling.  
The solution is made up of five web pages, the main page, three project pages, and a contact page.
Exploiting FlexBox, the web pages have been designed to scale to varying sizes of viewport.  

Specific solution features are not listed within this document, as that would be a cynical copy/paste of the requirements specification. However, some justification of my solution strategy will be offered. 
The solution has been pushed to my GitHub repository and published to GitHub Pages, for public access and review.

## The Solution:

### The Main Page:

The main page (index.html), fulfills the majority of challenge requirements. As the landing page, it is designed to be most atractive and engaging. It comprises a header and navigation bar (fixed), an Ethos section, a Projects section, and a Contact section. The The Projects section contains links to the project pages, and the Contact section links to a Contact Form.

### The Project Pages:

The project pages have been left intentionally blank, with minimal styling. The nav-bar on the project pages does function, allowing the user to return to the Home page.


### The Contact Form:

The Contact is intended to be functional and practical. The form is functional, though it can not be submitted.

### Poor Design Decisions

Early on in the design, I decided to use a banner image after the nav-bar on the main page. The image, I ripped from the Step8Up website (assets\images\StepUp.PNG). This poor decision had a significant design impact, as it greatly complicated the mixing and matching of background colours in adjacent containers. In order to achieve the colour effect that I wanted, I was forced to employ multiple colour transitions (i.e., colour-transition-div1, colour-transition-div2). This pain can with no gain, as the banner image did not fulfil any of the design specifications.

Proving that it's never too late to $#!t-can a bad idea, at the eleventh hour, I decided to to remove the image and normalise the main page. The finished results of my poor decision can be seen at index-old.html.


### Commenting:

I appreciate that the HTML and CSS files are still not adequately commented. I'll work to improve on that. I understand that good commenting can enhance:

- Collaboration.
- Clarity of purpose
- Self-documentation.
- Debugging and troubleshooting.
- Maintenance and evolution.
